# Database Management System for Myofficecab

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a structured and centralized Database Management System (DBMS) for Myofficecab, an eco-transportation company offering employee transportation solutions. The primary objective is to enhance data management, streamline ETL processes, and enable data-driven decision-making for the client.

## Key Objectives
- Create tables to store data related to employees, trips, vehicles, drivers, and customers.
- Implement an optimized DBMS architecture using MySQL.
- Enable efficient data management, analysis, and utilization for taking informed business decisions.
- Unlock valuable insights into key metrics such as month-on-month trips, top drivers, busiest days/times, frequently traveling employees, and high-profit segments.

## Approach
1. Conceptual Data Modeling: Developed an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to represent the relationships between different entities.
2. Relational Data Model: Designed a relational data model based on the ERD to structure the database tables and relationships.
3. Query Development: Implemented SQL queries to retrieve insights and generate reports on key metrics, including month-on-month trips, busiest times, top drivers, and frequently traveling employees.
4. Data Analysis: Analyzed the queried data to uncover valuable insights and patterns for the client's business operations.

## Outcomes
- Established a centralized DBMS for Myofficecab, enabling efficient data management and analysis.
- Generated insights into key performance indicators through SQL queries and data analysis.
- Provided recommendations for process optimization, operational expansion, and future database improvements.
